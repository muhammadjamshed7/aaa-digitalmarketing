                Why Website Performance Matters for E-Commerce
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                In the highly competitive world of e-commerce, performance is key to retaining customers and driving
                sales. A slow or unresponsive website can cause visitors to leave, which means missed opportunities for
                conversions. By improving site performance, you can increase user engagement, satisfaction, and ultimately,
                your bottom line.

                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                    A slow-loading website can cause users to leave before they make a purchase. Optimizing your website’s
                    speed can significantly improve conversion rates.
