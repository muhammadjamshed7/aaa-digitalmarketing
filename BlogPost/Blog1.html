            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                Here are the top trends that are shaping the future of web development and should be incorporated into your
                website strategy in 2025:
            </p>

            <p class="text-primary font-bold pt-5 text-xl leading-9 tracking-wide">
                1. AI Integration for Smarter Websites
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                AI is transforming how websites interact with visitors. From 24/7 chatbots to personalized content recommendations,
                AI can enhance user engagement, streamline communication, and increase sales.
            </p>

            <p class="text-primary font-bold pt-5 text-xl leading-9 tracking-wide">
                2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                PWAs combine the best aspects of mobile apps and websites. Offering faster, more reliable, and offline
                experiences, PWAs can significantly improve user satisfaction and engagement.
            </p>

            <p class="text-primary font-bold pt-5 text-xl leading-9 tracking-wide">
                3. Voice Search Optimization
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                Voice search is becoming increasingly popular. Optimizing your website for voice search with natural,
                conversational keywords can improve search engine visibility and make your site more accessible.
            </p>

            <p class="text-primary font-bold pt-5 text-xl leading-9 tracking-wide">
                4. Dark Mode Design
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                The dark mode trend continues to grow. By offering dark mode on your website, you cater to user preferences,
                reduce eye strain, and create a visually appealing experience, particularly for night-time use.
            </p>

            <p class="text-primary font-bold pt-5 text-xl leading-9 tracking-wide">
                5. Interactive Web Design & Motion UI
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-9 tracking-wide">
                Interactive web elements and motion UI are transforming websites into dynamic, engaging platforms. Adding
                interactive features like animated buttons and transitions enhances user retention and engagement.
            </p>
